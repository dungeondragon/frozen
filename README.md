I googled the most popular programming languages and found on several sites that Python was ratest highest in the top 10 for 2020. Thats why I started with it. (And also because of all funny python memes I've read on /r/ProgrammerHumor.) 

python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
Allready installed on the linux dist. The Python interactive mode was great!
I like the no semicolon and I did never have problems with the indentation.
Easy to use and understand. Not so many lines of code. Clean and neat. Straight forward.
Estimated time: Half a day. But that includes solving the task of finding an api for the weather data, understanding the json and figuring out how I wanted the code to look. 


Next choise is Perl. Not because it was popular but because I've always seen Perl as a magic language. In years I have admired a friends friend for building a DNS server in Perl. And yes, I might have been influenced by this comic strip from xkcd.com/208.

perl -v
This is perl 5, version 22, subversion 1 (v5.22.1)
* apt-get install libjson-perl
With Perl it wasn't as easy to get the decoded json object values as in Python. I also stumbled on writing eq instead of == while comparing string values. I dind't feel any flow writing Perl as i did in Python. It took much more time figuring out the little things I had to do. 
Happy about the Data::Dumper library for debugging features.
Estimated time: one day banging my head against the wall.


Ruby. I know that Ruby and Python are often compared to eachother. It would be nice to know their differences. And, of course, this tweet from some years ago. https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/712743526086414336

ruby -v
ruby 2.3.1p112
Plus for the Interactive Ruby Prompt (irb) 
It was really really easy to finish the task in Ruby. Even if it's more declarative than Python I think it's more clear what you intend to do. And I like the each method in Ruby better than the for loop in Python.
Estimated time: not even two hours.


R?
